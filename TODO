- Compare the 'phpgacl' (included with dotProject) with the original code.
- Find files that use (require/include) the 'session.php'.
- Check the utilization of global variables within each file included at dotproject.class.php.
  * Make sure that the code included will be used just after the global variables are defined at index.php.
- Upgrade the phpgacl and smarty (libs/).
