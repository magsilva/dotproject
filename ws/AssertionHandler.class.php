	 * suites because they allow you to easily capture the code passed to the
	 * assertion, along with information on where the assertion was made. While
	 * this information can be captured via other methods, using assertions
	 * makes it much faster and easier!
	 * 
	 * @param $file The file the assertion failed in.
	 * @param $line The line the assertion failed on.
	 * @param $code Contain the expression that failed (if any - literal values
	 * such as 1 or "two" will not be passed via this argument)
